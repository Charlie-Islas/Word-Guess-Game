Welcome to the Feline Hangman Game!

Get yourself ready to guess feline species or perish under the big cats' claws!

Be sure to read the following instructions to avoid any confusion, even if the game itself is self-explanatory.

1. When you first enter, you must press any key to start playing.

2. A picture of a feline species will be shown to you and you have to guess its name.

3. As we all know, all cats have seven lives. This is the maximum number of mistakes you can make. 
Beware! If you exceed this number, you'll be sent to devoured by the Roman lions!

4. Once you guess the species or get defeated and devoured, you'll have to press "f" in order to guess the following species.

5. You will receive a congratulations message when you manage to go through all species in the game.

6. There is a counter where you will be able to see your score at all times, as well as the letters that you've already used.

7. And that's all. Be prepared to guess, and enjoy!
